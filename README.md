## Cryptimeleon Groupsig
**WARNING: This library is meant to be used for prototyping and as a research tool *only*. 
It has not been sufficiently vetted to use in production**

This library offers interfaces and tests useful for implementing group signatures as well as example implementations in Java 8.
The interfaces have largely been derived from [DiaArrRod15].

## Implementations
We are currently working on implementing the traceable group signature from [ChoParYun06].
