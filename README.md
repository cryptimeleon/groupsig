## upb.crypto.groupsig
**Warning: This library is used for research purposes *only* and is *not* sufficiently vetted for production use.**

This library offers interfaces and tests useful for implementing group signatures as well as example implementations in Java 8.
The interfaces have largely been derived from [DiaArrRod15].

## Implementations
We are currently working on implementing the traceable group signature from [ChoParYun06].
